## welcome

Hi, thanks for dropping by! Keep reading to learn about me, my journey to learn web development skills, and follow my progress.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @milodubois
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting other developers and learning more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails ...

## about Milo

I just recently started to learn the foundations of web development by following lessons and tutorials from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) in May 2022. My objective is to learn enough skills to eventually become a skilled fullstack web developer.  So far, I have been having a blast!  

I would like to connect with others, regardless to network, share tips, and encourage our mutual progress. If this sounds like a plan, please feel free to drop me a line.

## about this repository

I created this public repository to document my learning journey and to also showcase projects as I complete them. Currently, I've completed the "HTML Foundations" and "CSS Foundations" coursework and am working my way through adding to that knowledge. The first project I completed is called 'odin-recipes' and that repository is listed below in the next section. To view that project's GitHub page, visit [https://milodubois.github.io/odin-recipes](https://milodubois.github.io/odin-recipes).
