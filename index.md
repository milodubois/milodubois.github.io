>Hey there! Quick note: I'll be away working on a bioinformatics project for several weeks rather than pursuing what brought me to GitHub initially in May 2022, namely my quest to learn front-end web development. Thus, I won't be updating this often.

# Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [@milodubois](https://github.com/milodubois). I'm a data scientist with specialization in computational and molecular biology, and fluency in Java, R, Python, and many other bioinformatics platforms and languages. However, I'm new to GitHub in the capacity of my new hobby, learning front-end web development, something I kind of neglected while being so focused on research in school and work.  

## What brought me to GitHub

I thought it would be fun to learn additional skills including web development, more of as *hobby* (and by hobby, I do not disparage front-end dev at all--I use "hobby" because I do _not_ expect to become as skilled as most front-end developers). If I'm lucky, I may be able to use some of what I learn in my professional work, but for now, I'm keeping the two separate, hence the newness of my GitHub presence. You can follow my front-end learning progress in my public repositories.

## Career sketch and languages

My career work focuses on bioinformatics projects and building solutions using Perl, Python, R, Java, Scala, C and C++. Typical professional projects integrate knowledge of molecular biology with coding, aimed at target discovery and evaluation for biopharma applications. I'm not looking for work at the moment, as I have my hands full consulting as an external project manager on two data science projects at a start-up.

## Let's connect!

Primarily, I'm here because:

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in meeting other developers and learning more about front-end web dev as I continue my hobby
- Maybe I can help share some tips and tricks from my professional experiences
- My *spoken* languages include English, German, and Spanish (I can *comprehend* a few others, but not conversationally).
- I'm a classical music enthusiast!  


Cheers!  
*Milo*

P.S., I don't plan on updating this blog for a while, but will instead just update my *public* repositories as I learn more.

P.P.S., I am working on a side "hobby" project to teach basic shell skills, as time permits. If you'd like to help out, let's connect!
