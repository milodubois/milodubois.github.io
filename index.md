# Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [@milodubois](https://github.com/milodubois). I'm a scientist with specialization in computational and molecular biology, and expertise in Java, R, Python, and many non-FOSS commercial computational solutions. Like many, I had to shift during the emergence of the pandemic to independent projects as a consultant rather than working for an institution. Following, I thought it wise to learn additional skills including web development. Thus, I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in May 2022, which brings me to GitHub for the first time in a personal capacity. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in meeting other developers and learning more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails ...
- My *spoken* languages include English, German, and Spanish
- I'm a classical music enthusiast!


Cheers!  
*Milo*
