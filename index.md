## about Milo

I have a background in science and data science, but just recently started to learn the foundations of web development by following lessons and tutorials from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) in May 2022. My objective is to learn enough skills to eventually become a skilled fullstack web developer.  My background is primarily in Java and Python, so I am very new to front-end web development, especially HTML and CSS.

Also, I'm new to GitHub, with most of my Java and Python work hosted elsewhere.

I could a lot of help on learning and practicing web development, let's connect!
